## Multi-Grained Guided Diffusion Model
- In this paper, we explore a novel task, quantity-controlled remote sensing object generation, and propose a novel model, **Multi-Grained Guided Diffusion** (MGDiff). The MGDiff imposes constraints not only on latent space noise prediction, but also on high-level semantic features of object instances at both global counting and spatial distribution granularities, establishing training guidance across three distinct grained levels.

The counting branch provides global-granularity quantity guidance and the segmentation branch provides spatial-granularity distribution guidance. After training, the counting and segmentation branches **can be removed** during the object generation.

## Levir-QCG Dataset
- The Levir-QCG dataset contains remote sensing images annotated with precise instance quantity and pixel-wise object masks. The dataset contains images covering 5 object types: building, harbor, plane, storage tank, and tennis court.

The test set is available now. It can be downloaded by [Baidu Drive](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1Esteen3FSvDoFCXwi5-A6Q). Extraction code: k6fy

We will provide the download link for the entire dataset as soon as the paper has been officially published.
